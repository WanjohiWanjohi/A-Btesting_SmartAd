For the company SmartAd , the major source of revenue is from charging clients based on 
the user engagement each served automated advertisement receives.

# Data & Hypothesis
"If you want to do good science, you should determine your hypotheses before looking at
the data, you should clean your data without the hypotheses in mind, and you should keep
in mind that p-values are not substitutes for common sense." -Joel Grus (Data Science from Scratch)

The experimental feature for this dataset is -being exposed to an ad from SmartAd- .

This divides the population into two groups:
1. Those exposed to an ad by SmartAd(exposed)
2. Those shown a dummy ad (control)

Our null hyoothesis (Ho) =  the change in the advertisement made for the exposed group would result in no change in the conversion rate
